# Real-time Bidding System Implementation

This feature adds WebSocket-based real-time bidding capabilities to the Waste2Product marketplace. When users place bids, they appear instantly for other users viewing the same listing, and bid cards on the dashboard update in real-time.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

The project now requires Laravel Echo and Pusher.js:

```bash
npm install laravel-echo pusher-js
```

### 2. Configure Pusher

1. Create a Pusher account at [https://pusher.com/](https://pusher.com/)
2. Create a new Channels app in your Pusher dashboard
3. Copy your app credentials (app_id, key, secret, cluster)
4. Add these credentials to your `.env` file:

```
BROADCAST_DRIVER=pusher
PUSHER_APP_ID=2065325
PUSHER_APP_KEY=c8652c49f017e104a528
PUSHER_APP_SECRET=1a3c194e9d529008eac9
PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER=eu
PUSHER_HOST=
PUSHER_PORT=443
PUSHER_SCHEME=https
PUSHER_APP_ENCRYPTED=true

# Frontend env variables (for Vite)
VITE_PUSHER_APP_KEY="${PUSHER_APP_KEY}"
VITE_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER="${PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER}"
```

### 3. Build Assets

```bash
npm run build
```

## System Components

1. **Laravel Echo Configuration**: Initialized in `resources/js/bidSocket.js`
2. **Bid Event Broadcasting**: When bids are created or updated, the system broadcasts events via Pusher
3. **Real-time UI Updates**:
   - Bid Modal: Updates to show new bids as they come in
   - Dashboard Cards: Update bid counts and amounts in real-time

## How It Works

1. When a user makes a bid, the `BidController` creates the bid and broadcasts a `BidSubmitted` event
2. Other users viewing the same waste item's bid modal receive this event through WebSockets
3. The client-side JavaScript updates the UI to show the new bid without page refresh
4. Dashboard bid cards also update in real-time with visual indicators

## Channels

- `waste-item.{id}.bids` - Public channel for bids on a specific waste item
- `user.{id}.bids` - Private channel for a user's bid activity

## Testing the Feature

1. Open two browser windows (use incognito for the second user)
2. Navigate to the same waste item listing in both windows
3. Open the bid modal in both windows
4. Submit a bid from one window
5. Observe the bid appearing in real-time in the other window
6. Check the dashboard to see real-time updates on bid cards

## Troubleshooting

- Check browser console for any WebSocket connection errors
- Verify Pusher credentials in the `.env` file
- Ensure you've built the assets after changes with `npm run build`
- Check Pusher dashboard for connection status and debug events
